                <p>Micro Jam is an internal event of the Micro Club. It lasts for three (3) days and revolves around video game development. It is a competition that is both fun and educational, bringing together club members who are passionate about this field, which is still relatively rare in Algeria but has a potentially bright future!
                    In addition, with coaching and collective activities, this event offers everything participants need to make the most of three days in their careers as game developers.</p>
